# BanWarn

**Welcome to the 2.0.0 branch. Originally started in late 2016, but soon abandoned due to doing everything exactly in the worst way it could have been done. Plugin development is not about typing characters on a black background. You have to see your code work, interact with and do stuff. Also - who tf writes release schedules for a one-man project. So I welcome you to 2.0.0 in mid 2018. While I still want to do some aspects the retro-way and rediscover something I missed for a long time now, I now focus on actually getting stuff done and not writing tons of messages that are for no use for anyone. So, without further ado, welcome to this experiment. Let's see how this turns out.

####This is the 2.0.0 branch. You _do_ not want to use this. Seriously though, this is not anywhere production ready (and at the moment not even working).

**TravisCI** [![TravisCI](https://api.travis-ci.org/robske110/BanWarn.svg?branch=2.0.0)](https://travis-ci.org/robske110/BanWarn)

###Version `1.2.3` is **stable** for production and recommended for all BanWarn users! [**RELEASE**](https://github.com/robske110/BanWarn/releases/tag/1.2.3)
